# Project 2

# Crowdfunding-ETL

<p>This is an exercise to perform ETL on a Crowdfunding campaign. The starting data are contained in two separate Excel workbooks.</p>

----

## Associated Files:
- 2 Excel files (source data)
- SQL schemata file that creates database & and associated tables.
- ERD document that outlines relationships between the tables
- 5 exported CSV files
- 4 screenshots showing all data successfully loaded into their respective tables.
- Jupyter Notebook file that shows results in final output. There were two options to ETL the data-- I performed both.

Although this project was to be done in teams of two, I chose to complete it on my own in order in order to benefit from completing the entire exercise, rather than just a part of it.
